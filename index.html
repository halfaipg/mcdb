            <ul>
                <li class="signature-dish"><strong>The McRibTini:</strong> It's back! Served in a martini glass, garnished with a single, questionable pickle slice. Consume responsibly (or irresponsibly, we don't care). Pairs well with existential dread.</li>
                <li><strong>Applebee's Bourbon Street Steak Nugget™:</strong> All the flavor of Bourbon Street, minus the dignity. Deep-fried, shaped like a nugget, served with a side of high-fructose corn syrup "glaze". Contains 78 ingredients, only 3 of which came from an actual cow!</li>
                <img src="images/steak-nugget.png" alt="Bourbon Street Steak Nugget, looking sad" class="menu-image">
                <li><strong>Endless Fries & Anxiety Platter:</strong> All-you-can-eat fries! Seriously, they never stop coming. Neither does the creeping feeling that you've made poor life choices. Comes with complimentary napkins for crying. Our potatoes are washed in 13 different chemicals before being fried in oil that's been reused since 2017!</li>
                <li><strong>Deep-Fried Salad Surprise:</strong> We battered and deep-fried iceberg lettuce. Why? Because we could. The "surprise" is the immediate onset of heartburn. Dressing available: Ranch or Regret. Fun fact: our Ranch dressing has more calories than a cheeseburger!</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unparalleled Mediocrity:</strong> We've perfected the art of being aggressively "fine". Just like how your body feels after decades of processed food—not exactly sick, but definitely not thriving.</li>
                <li><strong>Caloric Density:</strong> Get the most calories for your dollar, and the least nutritional value! Efficiency! Our foods have been scientifically engineered to maximize profit per square inch of your expanding waistline.</li>

                <li><strong>That Vague Feeling of Unease:</strong> Is it the food? The decor? Society? Yes. Is it also your liver struggling to process the 57 different synthetic compounds in your meal? Also yes!</li>
                <li><strong>The Authentic American Experience:</strong> Where else can you get diabetes, heart disease, and chronic pain without even trying? It's the American Dream™!</li>

            <h3>The SAD Truth (From Real Scientists!)</h3>
            <img src="images/sad-chart.png" alt="A confusing chart implying bad things" class="info-image">
            <div class="sad-quote">
                "Obesity and chronic pain often co-occur. Obesity is considered a risk factor for chronic pain and studies show that obese individuals report greater pain."
                <br>— <cite>Totsch et al., 2020</cite>
            </div>
            <p>Let's be real. You know this isn't food. We know this isn't food. But it's cheap, it's fast, and it fills the void... temporarily.</p>
            <p>According to actual scientists (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7653164/" target="_blank">Totsch et al., 2020</a>), even just weekend binges on a poor-quality diet (the SAD weekend) can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prolong recovery from injury</strong> - Turns out your body doesn't have a "cheat day" mode!</li>
                <li><strong>Dramatically alter your gut microbiome</strong> - Those little bugs in your gut hate this stuff as much as your dignity does!</li> 
                <li><strong>Increase inflammation</strong> - Like you needed MORE inflammation in 2024!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, basically, it's not just your soul that's dying slowly. Enjoy your engineered edible product!</p>

            <h3>The SAD Reality Check: Your Daily Poison Platter</h3>
            
            <p>Take a moment to look at what you've eaten today. Go ahead, we'll wait. Was it beige? Came in a box? Needed a microwave? Congratulations, you're participating in the greatest dietary experiment in human history!</p>
            
            <div class="sad-quote">
                "One major environmental factor that contributes to obesity is a poor-quality diet. Evidence shows that a high-fat diet contributes to inflammation and pain behaviors... even in the absence of obesity."
                <br>— <cite>Totsch et al., 2020</cite>
            </div>
            
            <h4>What Sets The SAD Apart From Every Other Diet In Human History:</h4>
            <ul class="bleak-facts">
                <li><strong>Unprecedented Processing:</strong> Your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize 80% of what you eat as food. That's not progress, that's a horror movie.</li>
                <li><strong>Engineered Addiction:</strong> Foods specifically designed to hit the "bliss point" of salt, sugar and fat. They literally engineer it to be impossible to stop eating. Like cigarettes, but with cheese.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflammatory Ingredients:</strong> The average American consumes ingredients that their immune system treats as invaders, creating constant, low-grade inflammation throughout their entire body.</li>
                <li><strong>Microbiome Massacre:</strong> Your gut bacteria—which control everything from your immune system to your mood—are being systematically exterminated by preservatives, emulsifiers, and lack of fiber.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What's Actually In Your Food:</h4>
            <div class="ingredient-list">
                <p>The average processed food product contains ingredients that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are banned in other developed countries</li>
                    <li>Were originally developed as petroleum byproducts</li>
                    <li>Have names you can't pronounce without a PhD in chemistry</li>
                    <li>Have never been tested for long-term human consumption</li>
                    <li>Were approved by regulatory bodies heavily influenced by the very companies producing them</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sad-quote">
                "Diet directly affects the gut microbiota, which can have subsequent effects on inflammation and contribute to other chronic states."
                <br>— <cite>Totsch et al., 2020</cite>
            </div>
            
            <p>The most tragic part? This is <em>normal</em> to you. You've been eating this way your whole life, surrounded by others doing the same, bombarded by advertisements convincing you it's fine, it's convenient, it's delicious!</p>
            
            <p>But here's the kicker—your body doesn't care about convenience or marketing. Your cells don't know you were busy or tired. Your gut microbiome doesn't understand why you couldn't cook. Your immune system can't tell the difference between a pathogen and the chemical stew you've been feeding yourself daily.</p>
            
            <p>Just remember: every time you choose "fast" over "food," you're trading minutes at the drive-thru for days in the doctor's office later.</p>
